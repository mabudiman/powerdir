Imba handles all events in the dom through a single manager, listening at the root of your document. Each native event is wrapped in an Imba.Event-instance, which has a few methods worth knowing:

```imba
tag CustomElement
    def onclick event
        event.target # returns the Imba.Tag target for event
        event.native # returns the native DOMEvent
        event.type # returns the type of event, in this case 'click'
        event.prevent # calls preventDefault on the native event
        event.stop # calls stopPropagation on the native event

        # a bunch of methods accessing native event
        event.x # Event:x
        event.y # event.native:y
        event.button # event.native:button
        event.which # event.native:which
        event.alt # event.native:altKey
        event.shift # shiftKey
        event.ctrl # event.native:ctrlKey
        event.meta # event.native:metaKey
```
