```imba
let element = <div.main> "Hello"
```

The above declaration might look strange at first. DOM elements are first-class citizens in Imba. We are creating a *real* dom element, with the className "main" and textContent "Hello".

Let's break down the basic syntax before we move on to more advanced examples. Since setting classes of elements is very common, imba has a special shorthand syntax for this. You declare classes by adding a bunch of `.classname` after the tag type. You can add multiple classes like `<div.large.header.primary>`. Can you guess how to set the id of a tag? It uses a similar syntax: `<div#app.large.ready>`.
