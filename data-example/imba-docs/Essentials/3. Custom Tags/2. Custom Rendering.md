Just like components in react, you can declare how custom tags should render, by declaring a render method:

```imba
# define a custom tag, inheriting from form
tag App
    def render
        <self> <h1> "Hello world"

let app = <App.main>
# The DOM tree of app is now:
# <div class='App main'><h1>Hello world</h1></div>
```

> `<self>` inside render deserves some explanation. In Imba, instances of tags are directly linked to their real DOM element. `<self>` refers to the component itself, and is a way of saying "now I want the content inside self to look exactly like the following. This is important to understand.

```imba
tag Wrong
    def render
        <h1> "Hello {Math.random}"

let wrong = <Wrong>
# wrong.render would now simply create a new h1 element
# every time it is called. The DOM element of wrong will
# still have no children.

tag Right
    def render
        <self> <h1> "Hello {Math.random}"
let right = <Right>
# right.render will now update its own DOM tree every time
# it is called, ensuring that the DOM is in fact reflecting
# the view declared inside <self> 
```
