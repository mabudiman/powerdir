> This guide assumes knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (or another programming language). It will be especially helpful to know React to grasp how tags and custom tags work.

The easiest way to get started with Imba is to play around in the [scrimba.com Hello World example](https://scrimba.com/c/cE4nGcg). If you rather want to try Imba in your own environment you can clone [hello-world-imba](https://github.com/somebee/hello-world-imba) and follow the instructions in the readme. There are plugins available for [Sublime Text](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Imba), [VSCode](https://github.com/somebee/vscode-imba) and [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/language-imba).
