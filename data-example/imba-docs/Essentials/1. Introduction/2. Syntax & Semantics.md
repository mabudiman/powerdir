Even though the syntax and semantics of Imba is much more related to Ruby than JavaScript, it does compile down to plain performant JavaScript, and is fully compatible with any existing JavaScript library. Imba does not extend any native types from JavaScript. Arrays are arrays, strings are strings, numbers are numbers, classes are constructors with prototypes and so forth. If you simply like Imba better, there is no reason not to write your npm package in Imba, even if it is supposed to be used in the general JavaScript ecosystem. In fact, Imba produces *very* readable JavaScript, by keeping your indentation, comments, and coding style.

```imba
# Strings
var single = 'single quotes'
var double = "double quotes"
var interpolation = "string has {double}"

# Numbers
var integer = 42
var float = 42.10

# Objects
var object = {name: 'Imba', type: 'Language'}

# Arrays
var array = [1,2,3,4,5]

# Regular expressions
var regex = /number is (\d+)/

# Functions
def hello
    console.log 'got here'
    return 'world'

# Classes
class Todo
    # automatic getter/setter declaration
    prop title

    def initialize title
        # instance variables
        @title = title
        @completed = no

    def complete
        @completed = yes

# Tags
var item = <div.header> "This is a div"
var list = <ul.list> for item in ["one","two","three"]
    <li> <span.name> item
```
