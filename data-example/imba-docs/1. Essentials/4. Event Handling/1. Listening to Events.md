We can use `<tag :eventname=handler>` to listen to DOM events and run code when theyâ€™re triggered.

```imba
tag App
    prop counter
    def render
        <self.bar>
            # handler will be called when clicking button
            <button :click=(do counter++)> "Increment"
            <div> "count is {counter}"

Imba.mount <App counter=0>
```

In the example above we declared the handler inline. Usually it is better to define the handlers outside of the view, and decouple them from the event itself. This can be done in several ways.
