Inspired by vue.js, Imba also supports modifiers. More often than not, event handlers are simple functions that do some benign thing with the incoming event (stopPropagation, preventDefault etc), and then continues on with the actual logic. By using modifiers directly where we bind to an event, our handlers never need to know about the event in the first place.

```
# call preventDefault on the submit-event, then call doSomething
<form :submit.prevent.doSomething>
```

> What is the difference between a modifier and a handler in this case? There isn't really a difference. In fact, the modifiers are implemented as methods on element, and you can define custom modifiers as well.

* `.stop` - stops event from propagating
* `.prevent` - calls preventDefault on event
* `.silence` - explicitly tell Imba not to broadcast event to schedulers
* `.self` - only trigger subsequent handlers if event.target is the element itself### Key Modifiers

For keyboard events (keydown, keyup, keypress) there are also some very handy modifiers available.
```
# trigger addItem when enter is pressed
<input type='text' :keydown.enter.addItem>

# multiple handlers for the same event is allowed
# trigger gotoPrev/gotoNext when pressing up/down keys
<div :keydown.up.gotoPrev :keydown.down.gotoNext>
```
 
* .left
* .right
* .up
* .down
* .enter
* .tab
* .esc
* .space
* .del

### System Modifier Keys

* .ctrl
* .alt
* .shift
* .meta


```
# only trigger when ctrl is pressed
<button :click.ctrl.myHandler>

# only trigger when shift is pressed
<button :click.shift.myHandler>

# the order of modifiers matters;
# always prevent default action, but only trigger myHandler if alt as pressed
<button :click.prevent.alt.myHandler>
```

### Mouse Button Modifiers
