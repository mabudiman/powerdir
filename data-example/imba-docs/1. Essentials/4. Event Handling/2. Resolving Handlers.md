You can also supply a string as the handler (`<div :click="doSomething">`). In this case, Imba will look for a method of that name on the current context (self). This means that if you have defined methods on your custom tags, you can refer to these methods. Since binding events is such an integral part of developing web applications, Imba also has a special syntax for this.

```imba
tag App
    prop counter

    def increment
        counter++

    def step amount
        counter += amount

    def render
        <self.bar>
            # inline handler
            <button :click=(do counter++)> "+1"
            # reference to a method on self
            <button :click='increment'> "+1"
            # reference with arguments
            <button :click=['step',2]> "+2"
            # shorthand reference
            <button :click.increment> "+1"
            # shorthand reference with arguments
            <button :click.step(3)> "+3"

            <div> "count is {counter}"

Imba.mount <App counter=0>
```

> `tap` is an alias for `click` that works across mobile, tablets, and desktops.
