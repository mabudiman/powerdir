When an event is processed by Imba, it will also look for an `on(eventname)` method on the tags as it traverses up from the original target.

```
tag App
    def onsubmit e
        e.prevent
        window.alert('Tried to submit!')

    def render
        <self>
            <form>
                <input type='text'>
                <button type='submit'> "Submit"

Imba.mount <App>
```
