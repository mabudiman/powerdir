As we explain custom tags, you will learn that everything inside `<self>` is reactive by default. Ending a tag with  `->` or `=>` instead of `>` marks it as reactive, and allows you to call `render` on the tag to re-render the content.

```imba
var number = 0

var dead = Imba.mount <div>
    <span> "Dead time is {Date.new.toLocaleString}"
    <span> "Number is {number}"

var live = Imba.mount <div ->
    <span> "Live time is {Date.new.toLocaleString}"
    <span> "Number is {number}"

setInterval(&,1000) do
    number++
    dead.render # nothing changes
    live.render # content is updated
```
