You might notice that we never close our tags. Rather than being delimited by curly braces or “begin/end” keywords, blocks are delimited by indentation, and so are tags. This might seem weird in the beginning, but it makes for very readable and concise code. So, if we want to create a list with some children, we simply go:

```imba
<ul>
    <li> "Understand indentation"
    <li> "Get used to it"
    <li> "Cherish it"
```

If we have a dynamic list we can simply use a `for in` loop:

```imba
<ul> for activity in ["Eat", "Sleep", "Code"]
    <li> <span.name> activity
```
