You can easily define your own tags / components, as easily as creating classes. They are similar to components in react. Tags are defined with the `tag` keyword:

```imba
tag App
    # custom instance methods, properties etc

# create an instance of app - just like any other tag
let app = <App.main> <h1> "Hello"
```

Your custom tags will by default inherit from ‘div’, but they can inherit from any tag. You can also define instance methods on them.

```imba
# define a custom tag, inheriting from form
tag RegisterForm < form
    def onsubmit event
        # declare handlers as methods
        console.log "submitted"

    def someMethod
        console.log "hello"
        self

# create an instance of app - just like any other tag
let form = <RegisterForm>
form.someMethod # => "hello"
```

> When you declare `tag SomeComponent` you are declaring a new tag *type*, not an instance. It is exactly the same as declaring a new `class SomeClass` . `<SomeComponent>` creates a new *instance* of this tag, just like `SomeClass.new` creates a new instance of said class.
