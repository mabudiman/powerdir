Custom tags can inherit from other custom tags, or from native tags. E.g. if you want to create a custom form component, you can simply inherit from form:

```imba
tag RegisterForm < Form

let view = <RegisterForm>
# the DOM element of view is now of type form.
# html: <form class='RegisterForm'></form>
```
